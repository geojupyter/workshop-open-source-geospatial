## [Chelle Gentemann](https://cgentemann.github.io/)

**Program Scientist @ [NASA](https://nasa.gov)**

Dr. Chelle Gentemann is NASA's [Open Science](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/)
Program Scientist with 30 years of satellite mission experience, focusing on
oceanographic remote sensing and climate monitoring from space.
She leads transformative initiatives in open science, cloud computing, and geospatial
data accessibility to increase scientific participation and collaboration.


## [Matt Fisher](https://mfisher87.github.io)

**Research Software Engineer @ [Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment, UC Berkeley](https://dse.berkeley.edu/)**

I'm an open source contributor and maintainer with a background in geospatial data, the
cryosphere, and accessibility. I help maintain
[earthaccess](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/) to enable access to NASA data in 3
lines of code.
I'm also a community manager, leading the
[GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org/) project to make working with geospatial data more
approachable and enjoyable for all.

## [Max Jones](https://github.com/maxrjones)

**Cloud Engineer @ [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/)**

I build open-source solutions that enable change on a global scale as an engineer at
Development Seed. I enjoy increasing the accessibility of data that drive decision-making and
particularly love solving geospatial problems. I serve on the editorial board for the Cloud Native
Geospatial Forum (founding member), the Pangeo Steering Council, and contribute to many scientific
Python libraries. At the moment, I'm focused on optimizing delivery of NASA datasets using Virtual Zarr.
I'm also currently improving my skills in Kubernetes and Rust.

## [Qiusheng Wu](https://github.com/giswqs)

**Associate Professor @ [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://geography.utk.edu/people/instructional-faculty/wu-qiusheng/)**

Dr. Wu’s research focuses on geospatial data science and open-source software development. He is the creator of several widely used open-source Python packages, including geemap, leafmap, segment-geospatial, and geoai, which support advanced geospatial analysis and interactive visualization. His open-source work is available at <https://github.com/opengeos>.

## [Tyler Erickson](https://www.analyze.earth/)

**Founder @ [VorGeo](https://www.vorgeo.com/)**

Dr. Tyler Erickson is the founder of the geospatial consultancy VorGeo, a Technical Fellow at non-profit [Radiant Earth](https://radiant.earth/), and a founding editorial board member of the [Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum](https://cloudnativegeo.org/). Previously he led the developer relations team for [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). Dr. Erickson's work focuses on building communities & ecosystems around emerging technologies, with an emphasis on technologies that can be leveraged by environmental sustainability projects.

## [Tasha Snow](https://tsnow03.github.io)

**Research Scientist @ [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) / Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC), University of Maryland](https://essic.umd.edu/)** \
**Co-Founder @ [CryoCloud](https://cryointhecloud.com)**

I am one of the leads of the CryoCloud community meant to help geoscientist transition to cloud computing, which revolves around a JupyterHub cloud computing platform. I provide training, maintain our environments, and develop data workflows that are idealized for geoscience work in the cloud.
I'm also a research scientist in the Cryospheric Sciences Lab at NASA GSFC and ESSIC. My research foci are glaciology, oceanography, cloud computing, and open science.
