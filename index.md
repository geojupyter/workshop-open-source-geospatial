## Workshop abstract

In an era where cutting-edge research demands flexibility, collaboration, and
reproducibility, having the right set of tools is imperative.
This workshop propels you into the future with modern, cloud-based workflows for
geospatial data analysis, exploration, visualization, storytelling, and sharing, all
leveraging open source tools and services.
Whether you are just starting or looking to enhance your skills , this hands-on workshop
is designed for you.
Join us to stay ahead in the evolving field of geospatial.

Participants will learn to work on an open cloud platform with JupyterHub;
analyze and explore data with tools like JupyterGIS and leafmap;
work in a fully collaborative environment with Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterGIS;
author technical content with MyST and Jupyter Book;
and share their research outcomes, including journal publications, websites, blog posts,
dashboards, and software packages.

Participants can expect a combination of guided instruction, live demonstrations, and
hands-on exercises, all using tools that are freely available as open source software.
We expect this workshop to be particularly valuable for practitioners seeking to
collaborate across teams, domains, or institutions and to advance their capacity to
perform reproducible research.

This workshop is designed for those with familiarity and a basic understanding of
geospatial data (e.g. raster vs. vector) and practical Python programming experience.
