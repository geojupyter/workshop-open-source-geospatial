# 🛑 Stopping your server

**It's important to stop your server when you're not using it.**
This way CryoCloud can keep its cost down and remain available for you to use for free
in the future!


## Hub Control Panel

Your "Hub Control Panel" allows you to manage your server.

To access the control panel, click **File**, then **Hub Control Panel**.

Click **Stop My Server**, and wait a few seconds.
Once your server is stopped, the **Stop My Server** button will disappear.

Click `Log Out` in the top right of your screen and you will be logged out, or you can
start a new server.

You can now close this tab and the other tab where you were just working.
