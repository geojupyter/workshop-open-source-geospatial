# 🔐 Configuring GitHub authentication

GitHub authentication on shared cloud infrastructure is complicated.

Always remember, "cloud" is the same as "someone else's computer".
It's not a good idea to store your credentials on someone else's computer!

For this reason, we use a special tool called `gh-scoped-creds` to provide a special
credential which grants restricted access to only certain GitHub resources for a limited
amount of time.


## Copy the GitHub authentication Notebook

There's a special notebook titled `GHAUTH.ipynb` in the `shared/` directory.

Right-click it, select "**Copy**", then return to your home directory by clicking the 📁
icon at the top of your file browser.
Finally, right click in the empty space in your home directory and select "**Paste**".

Right-click this notebook and select "Add Favorite" to enable quick access in the
future!

## Follow the instructions in the Notebook

**The first time you use this Notebook, you should open the "First time setup" hint and
follow the instructions within.**

After you've completed first-time setup, run the code cell at the end of the Notebook
and carefully follow the instructions output by this cell.


## Granting permission for pushing to additional repository

If you only granted access to one repository (recommended), you may want to add more
later.

You can update the list of repositories you want to grant access to by visiting the
[configuration page for the CryoCloud GitHub application](https://github.com/apps/cryocloud-github-access).
