:::{glossary}
DOI
: A "Digital Object Identifier" is a string of characters (e.g.
  <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.00865>) that uniquely identifies an object (_any_
  object: physical, digital, or conceptual).

Frontmatter
: A way of embedding metadata with [YAML](https://yaml.org/) at the front (top) of a
  document.
  Frontmatter can be embedded at the top of a Markdown document or in the first Markdown
  cell of a Jupyter Notebook.
  [Read more in the official MyST frontmatter docs](https://mystmd.org/guide/frontmatter).

Open science
: A movement to make research products (papers, data, software) and processes accessible
  to everyone.
  A more stringent interpretation of open science involves enabling not just access, but
  collaboration, throughout the scientific process, not just at the end.

ORCID
: An "Open Researcher and Contributor ID" that uniquely identifies an academic
  contributor and enables tracking and associating their identity with {term}`DOIs <DOI>`.
  [Read more on the official ORCID website](https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/).

Provenance
: The history or chronology of a thing.
  The provenance of your research products can be established and verified by publishing
  the source code and creating {term}`DOIs <DOI>`.

Scooping
: Being "beaten to the punch" or left in second place in the attempt to publish research
  or a discovery.
  This term is often used as a counter-argument for {term}`open science` by implying that
  sharing your work openly will result in plagiarism.
