# 🚦 Prerequisites

This workshop requires a few prerequisites:


## A *fully-charged* computer with a web browser installed

All activities in this workshop will be performed in a cloud computing environment
called [CryoCloud](https://cryointhecloud.com/).

**The only thing you need to have installed to participate is a web browser**!
This means you can participate even on a Chromebook or a locked-down corporate computer.


## A GitHub account

Please [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't already.


## Accept invitation to CryoCloud Slack

You have been sent an invitation to join the CryoCloud Slack!
Please accept it!

All asynchronous support will occur on this Slack; if you need support with setup steps
or questions after the workshop, Slack is the best place to ask.


## Complete the CryoCloud onboarding process

1. Fill out this short [Getting Started Survey](https://forms.gle/d8oP1gp9YikS2ixM8) to give us the
required information to get you on the hub.


2. Once we have your survey, within the next day or two we will invite you to the CryoCloud GitHub organization and CryoCloudUsers team (you will receive an email when we do this from GitHub **at the email you have linked to your GitHub profile**). Please accept this invitation within 7 days or it will disappear and we will need to resend it. Your membership on that GitHub team provides you with access to the CryoCloud hub.


3. Open up the [CryoCloud JupyterHub](https://hub.cryointhecloud.com) to make sure it works for you.
You will need your Github username and password to sign on. A 404 error message means you are not yet part of the GitHub org and need to accept the invitation from GitHub first.


### ⚠️ Critical: Accept the invitation to join the CryoCloud team

Once we have your github ID, we will send you an invitation to join a GitHub team that
will give you access to log in to CryoCloud.
**You must accept that invitation within 7 days!**

* [Click here to accept your invitation](https://github.com/orgs/CryoInTheCloud/invitation).
  You should see a simple page with a big green button to accept.
  If you don't, it's possible you already accepted your invitation, possibly by e-mail.
* [Log in to CryoCloud](https://hub.cryointhecloud.com/).
  If you see a "403 Forbidden" error, you don't have the correct access.
  Let a workshop organizer know, and give them your GitHub username, and we'll fix it
  right up!
  * You will see a dialog to "Authorize nasa-cryo-prod" on your first login.
    **Click the green "Authorize 2i2c-org" button**.
