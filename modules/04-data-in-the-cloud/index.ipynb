    "\n",
    "The cloud (as defined by [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) is a distributed collection of servers that host software and infrastructure, and it is accessed over the Internet. The map below (from [salesforce](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/aws-cloud-technical-professionals/explore-the-aws-global-infrastructure-technical-professionals)) shows [Amazon Web Service (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com)'s global distribution of data centers, which contain the resources that make up the AWS cloud. Three large cloud providers in the United States are [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us), but other cloud providers are larger elsewhere in the world and there are numerous smaller providers available.\n",

    "## What makes data on the cloud different?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosting data on the cloud differs from storing data locally (or on-premises) in a few important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Redundancy - you can easily replicate your data across multiple servers, which may be distributed across the globe\n",
    "- Reliability - cloud providers offer services for reliability, such as automated backups and recovery\n",
    "- Scalability - cloud object storage enables nearly limitless simultaneous access across users/connections, without needing to order or decommission servers or hard-drives\n",
    "- Accessibility - anyone in the world, with proper authorization, can rapidly access data shared on the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Gotchas: There are a couple of considerations to be aware of when working with data on the cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pay-as-you-go - Most cloud providers use pay-as-you-go pricing, where you only pay for the storage and services that you use. This can potentially reduce costs, especially upfront costs (e.g., you never need to buy a hard drive). However, **you may want to provide indefinite access or you may forget about data in storage, in both cases you may end up continuing to pay for data storage indefinitely**.\n",
    "- Time and cost of bringing data to your computer - Hosting the data on the cloud naturally means it's no longer already near your computer's processing resources. Transporting data from the cloud to your computer is expensive, since most cloud providers charge for any data leaving their network, and slow, since the data needs to travel large distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary solution for the second bullet, \"time and cost bringing data to your computer\", is \"data-proximate computing\" which involves running your code on computing resources in the same cloud location as your data. For example, I commonly use NASA data products that are hosted on AWS servers in the 'us-west-2' region, which corresponds to Oregon in the figure above. Following the \"data-proximate computing\" paradigm, I use AWS compute resources that are also in Oregon when working with those data, rather than downloading data to use the computing resources on my laptop in North Carolina. In addition to \"data-proximate computing\", there are many other ways to make working with data on the cloud cheaper and easier. Let's take a look!"

    "Cloud-native data are structured for efficient querying across a network. For this 101 tutorial, you can think of \"a network\" as synonymous with \"the internet\". You can learn more about these data in the [CNG data formats guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/), but here we'll just explore working with data that is, compared to data that isn't, optimized for cloud usage."

    "\n",
    "Now, for the really cool part! Using [VirtualiZarr](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/) + [Icechunk](https://icechunk.io/), we can rapidly open not just that file but all of the files included in the NLDAS3 dataset! In less than 2 seconds, we can have a lazy view of a dataset that contains 24 years of data. People will often use the term \"lazy loading\" when an operation loads metadata from a storage location, but does not load any actual data. Without the cloud-native adaptation virtual Zarr, it's not possible for a software library to determine how much data it should load from disk to get all the necessary metadata. Virtual Zarr is a faster, cheaper, and easier way to work with data on the cloud :rocket:."
