# 🪐 6 - GeoJupyter

:::{tip} 🧭 Where we are going
:icon: false

In this tutorial we will explore the functionality of JupyterGIS and how it can
integrate with a real analysis workflow.
:::

We'll work through this module together in a Jupyter Notebook!

# TODO: Joining late?

Open the `demo.md` notebook in the Module 6 directory within the workshop repository.
On your CryoCloud server, it should be at
`workshop-open-source-geospatial/modules/06-geojupyter/demo.ipynb`.

:::{hint}
We recommend sizing your server at 4GB for this Notebook.
